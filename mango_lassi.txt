Ingredients

    2 cups frozen ripe mango
    1/2 â€“ 1 cup coconut milk (or store-bought boxed or light canned)
    1/4 cup plain unsweetened coconut yogurt or any other yoghurt
    1 Tbsp lime juice (plus more to taste)

Instructions

Add mango, coconut milk (start with a smaller amount of coconut milk and work your way up as needed), coconut yogurt, and lime juice to a high-speed blender or food processor. 
Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.
Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding lime for acidity, coconut yogurt for thickness and tang, or coconut milk to thin.
Serve as is, or swirled with additional coconut yogurt. Fresh chopped mango, shredded coconut, and lime wedges also make a beautiful garnish.
Store leftovers covered in the fridge up to 24 hours (though best when fresh), or in the freezer up to 1 month. 
Yummy
